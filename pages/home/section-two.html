<p>Project CIRCLES builds awarenes, creates spaces for dialogue and data systems innovation, and combats discrimination and disadvantage experienced by informal actors within circular economies. Our research network aims to uncover how data systems can be designed and developed inclusively to improve circularity rates in developing countries, whilst contributing to equitable livelihoods and cities simultaneously.</p>
